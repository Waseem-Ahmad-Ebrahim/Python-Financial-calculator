#Financial Calculators Program
This Python program provides two financial calculators: an investment calculator and a home loan repayment (bond) calculator. It allows users to calculate the future value of their investments with either simple or compound interest and to determine the monthly repayments for a home loan based on the current value of the house, interest rate, and repayment period.
